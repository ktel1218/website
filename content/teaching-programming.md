Summary: Insights from my year of teaching programming to adult students
status: draft


This whole thing should be about how people are biased towards teaching programming through puzzles.


<!-- 

Honesty
Teachers of adult students are loath to give it.

Encouragement

Simple Examples
Imaginative students can use simple examples and extrapolate how to use them in concrete situations. You don't need to give examples that directly relate to what they might be doing on the job. Avoid mathy examples. It scares away some of the students
Hands On Experience

Learning Styles
Some students want puzzles to solve, some students do not. Especially in an environment of vocational training. I think there's a bias in 

Context

Authority
This part requires a lot of flexibility and maybe some acting skills. Some students need authority in a learning environment. Others __do not__. It's pretty amazing what learning environments do to people.
